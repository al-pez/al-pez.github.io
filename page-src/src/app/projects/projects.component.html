	<p>Some of my lastest personal projects; components and show-cases for the technologies I've been diving into lately (and other that I've been playing with for a while). If you're interested in seeing the source code of these and some other projects, refer to my <a href="https://github.com/alxpez">GitHub</a> profile.</p>

					<h3>wTher</h3>
					<p>Minimalistic world forecast application, built as a way to play around with the new Angular (2+) and some API's (google-places and openweathermap). You probably wouldn't change it for the good old question to Google, but neither was my intention when I developed it, I embrace it as a show-case/demo.</p>

					<h3>dynamic-table</h3>
					<p>Component for AngularJS (1.5.x) applications. It allows the addition/removal of columns on runtime without the need of reloading views/collections. This is a simple component that we needed in some of the last projects I worked on, to supply certain functionality. This is just a demo of the working component.</p>
