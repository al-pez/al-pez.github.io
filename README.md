# The stuff I like

This is just part of _my story_, and a small selection of the toys I like to play with.

As for me, I love to share new ways of creating software, and I always find myself eager to play with any new technology that pops around. Amazes me the feeling of brain-expansion when I start digging into the _candy box_ of a new paradigm changing software.

### Backend

**Java** is the language I speak the most, and [Spring](https://spring.io/projects) my favourite _accent_. Kind of like being in my hometown and speaking Spanish, but as a well-traveled person, I like to get out of my comfort-zone. Always eager to learn new languages.

The dependency management tool of my choice is [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). I like to use it even when dealing with frontend dependencies, if it's plausible, although certain occasions call for other (not less fancy) tools like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Bower](https://bower.io/).

### Frontend

I started off with **ActionScript3**, back then _when it was popular_, Adobe Flex (currently [Apache Flex](http://flex.apache.org/)), was a really neat toy to play with, and so I did for about 4 years.

After this sweet time, came a **JavaScript/HTML** transition. Swimming all over an ocean of tools, I stumble upon one framework that made me feel, somewhat, warm inside. [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) was my choice.

Nowdays, I fill my head up with google's new toy [Angular](https://angular.io/) (plain and simple, or _2_ how it was called before it's release).

### Data storage

- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - I've used it for most of my corporated developer life.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Eagerly taking in all that I can get of it during my _homie_ time.
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) - Looking forward to dive deeper into it to complement the previous one.

### CVS/DCVS

- [SVN](https://subversion.apache.org/) - Heavily used on my professional developing time.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Falling in love with it, while playing on my spare hours.

### Other goodies

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - The big whale that is taking over the whole scene (just getting started).
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) - So broad that I still haven't got to grasp the whole of it.
